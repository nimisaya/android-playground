# android-playground

## Overview

Ever wanted to learn how to make Android apps? I have, so I created this playground for myself. It's destined to be a hodge podge of experiments with little sense of order. It exists as a place of learning and play.

## Projects

1. Hello Shapes - playing with basic shapes in Jetpack compose
2. Image Playground - play around with ImageView

## Tutorials

As a part of a study group at work I will be learning Jetpack compose and including the related files here.
